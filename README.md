eCommerce project using Android Studio

11/28 - First commit.  Created splash screen (SplashActivity) and login (MainActivity).  Need to work on login functionality.  Need to create/setup the database for Users. The background image I used in my application is from:  <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/da/4e/01/da4e01b18b65ffb43d0a849b837e954b.jpg">FROM HERE</a>.<br><br>

11/29 - Added the Room stuff although it is not wired up yet to anything.  Created both login and register activities.  No functionality yet.<br><br>

11/30 - Didn't make as much progress as I would have liked.  I updated design in many activities and added some colors.  I would like to use Fragments, but I need to learn how.  I would like to connect the Users database to the login/register actions.  I would also like to figure out how to customize the top menu bar.
